			<h2>Angel: QUIT overnight</h2>
			<img src="i/quitters/angel-tepuke.jpg" alt="Angel from Te Puke New Zealand" class="black">
			<span class="location">Te Puke/New Zealand</span>
			<p><strong>I was a typical teenager rebelling against life and all authority, questioning everything around me.</strong> I was at uni studying philosophy and psychology which only made me more confused about life. When my parents separated I didn't take it too well and this manifested itself in many ways including alcoholism, drug taking and smoking. By the age of twenty I was practically a chain smoker.</p>

			<img src="i/quitters/diana-singapore.jpg" alt="Diana from Singapore" class="black">
			<span class="location">Singapore</span>
			<p>My Father was a heavy smoker, so I believed that smoking must be good and fun.  Often my brother and I would steal his cigarettes and hide in the bathroom to "smoke".  We thought it was really cool. When my Father left us, my Mum had to work so we were left alone most of the time.  That was the beginning of my troubled teenage years.</p>
